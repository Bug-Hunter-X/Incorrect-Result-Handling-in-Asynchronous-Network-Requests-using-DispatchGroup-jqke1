# Incorrect Result Handling in Asynchronous Network Requests using DispatchGroup

This example demonstrates an incorrect way to handle results from multiple asynchronous network requests using a DispatchGroup. The original code incorrectly calls the completion handler within the loop, making it impossible to collect and return all the results properly. The solution showcases a corrected approach that uses a mutable array to accumulate results and handle success/failure cases appropriately. This is a common issue when working with asynchronous operations and DispatchGroups in Swift, highlighting the importance of proper result handling and using a single completion handler to return aggregated data or errors.
